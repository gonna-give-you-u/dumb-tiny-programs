# some dumb tiny one-source-file programs i made in my free time (trash code warning (probably))
how to build: literally just `g++ $file.cpp` should work for linux (and maybe other unix systems like bsd)

for windows idk tbh but some may not work because of system things like syscalls

i made these programs on linux so it probably will compile and work for bsd (and other unix systems), but for windows ymmv

the programs compile for and work on both glibc and musl linux systems


tell me if my code sucks, i want to learn how to make it not suck
